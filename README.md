# Battleships

To run this application, both the Web UI and Web API need to be running.

- To run the Web API, open the solution in Visual Studio, and press F5 (I have been using VS2019)
- To run the Web UI, navigate to the WebUI directory and run the following:
```
npm i
npm start
```
- The application will be available on http://localhost:4200
